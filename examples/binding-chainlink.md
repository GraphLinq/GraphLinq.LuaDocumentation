# Binding ChainLink Price Feed SmartContract

## Introduction

!> To be able to start the tutorial you need to have done the **Log in the Terminal** tutorial, we will assume that you have done it before

In this tutorial we will bind a **ChainLink Price Feed SmartContract** from the **Ethereum Blockchain** and export each values in your graph.

## Setup the JSON ABI

For querying any SmartContract we need a **JSON ABI** of the contract itself.  
You will get it **from Etherscan directly if the contract is verified**.  

For the ChainLink Price Feed, we will take the **BTC/USD** price feed.  
[Link to the Etherscan contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c)  
In the **Contract** section we can retrieve the ABI for the contract, copy it and fill the **JSON ABI** block with the ABI copied.
